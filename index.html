        The 16th century brought many Jesuit missionaries to China, such as
        Matteo Ricci, who established missions where Western science was
        introduced, and where Europeans gathered knowledge of Chinese society,
        history, culture, and science. During the 18th century, merchants from
        Western Europe came to China in increasing numbers. However, merchants
        were confined to Guangzhou and the Portuguese colony of Macau, as they
        had been since the 16th century. European traders were increasingly
        irritated by what they saw as the relatively high customs duties they
        had to pay and by the attempts to curb the growing import trade in
        opium. By 1800, its importation was forbidden by the imperial
        government. However, the opium trade continued to boom.
      </p>
      <p>
        Early in the 19th century, serious internal weaknesses developed in the
        Qing dynasty which left China vulnerable to Western, Meiji period
        Japanese, and Russian imperialism. In 1839, China found itself fighting
        the First Opium War with Britain. China was defeated, and in 1842,
        signed the provisions of the Treaty of Nanking which were first of the
        unequal treaties signed during the Qing dynasty. Hong Kong Island was
        ceded to Britain, and certain ports, including Shanghai and Guangzhou,
        were opened to British trade and residence. In 1856, the Second Opium
        War broke out. The Chinese were again defeated, and now forced to the
        terms of the 1858 Treaty of Tientsin. The treaty opened new ports to
        trade and allowed foreigners to travel in the interior. In addition,
        Christians gained the right to propagate their religion. The United
        States Treaty of Wanghia and Russia later obtained the same prerogatives
        in separate treaties.
      </p>
      <p>
        Toward the end of the 19th century, China appeared on the way to
        territorial dismemberment and economic vassalageâ€”the fate of India's
        rulers that played out much earlier. Several provisions of these
        treaties caused long-standing bitterness and humiliation among the
        Chinese: extraterritoriality (meaning that in a dispute with a Chinese
        person, a Westerner had the right to be tried in a court under the laws
        of his own country), customs regulation, and the right to station
        foreign warships in Chinese waters, including its navigable rivers.
